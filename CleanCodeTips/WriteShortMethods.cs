/*
 When writing code, use short methods. 
Short methods keep your code more organized and readable. 
Short methods are also easier to debug. If there is a problem with a method, 
you can quickly isolate it and fix it. 
That is much harder to do if the method is long and complex.
Additionally, if you need to change to a lengthy method, 
you may have to scroll through a lot of code to find the right place.
